# DeepLab: Deep Labelling for Semantic Image Segmentation

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation,
where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on)
to every pixel in the input image. Current implementation includes the following
features:



*   MobileNetv2:

  author={Mark Sandler and Andrew Howard and Menglong Zhu and Andrey Zhmoginov and Liang-Chieh Chen},
  booktitle={CVPR},

}
```

*  Architecture search for dense prediction cell:

  booktitle={NIPS},
  year={2018}
}

```

In the current implementation, we support adopting the following network
backbones:

1.  MobileNetv2 [8]: A fast network structure designed for mobile devices.

2.  Xception [9, 10]: A powerful network structure intended for server-side
    deployment.

This directory contains our TensorFlow [11] implementation. We provide codes
allowing users to train the model, evaluate results in terms of mIOU (mean
intersection-over-union), and visualize segmentation results. We use PASCAL VOC
2012 [12] and Cityscapes [13] semantic segmentation benchmarks as an example in
the code.
